        <p>
          My name is Yusuff Oyediran, a Seneca Student currently studying Computer Programming & Analysis in the 3rd and 4th semesters. I have an obsession with creating things from scratch
          like designing and developing websites, mobile apps and engineering. I love making music and watching movies. I believe that music is indeed my calling.
          I find myself singing and making melodies in my head, in fact, you can listen to my new music using this link My latest song. Enough of music.
          I have so many goals in life but one of them is to change how people think of Africa as a darkout continent and poor.
