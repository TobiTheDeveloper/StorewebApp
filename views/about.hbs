            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>My name is Yusuff Oyediran, a Seneca Student currently studying Computer Programming & Analysis in the 3rd and 4th semesters. 
              I have an obsession with creating things from scratch <br> like designing and developing websites, mobile apps and engineering. 
              I love making music and watching movies. I believe that music is indeed my calling. <br> 
              I find myself singing and making melodies in my head, in fact, you can listen to my new music using this link 
              <a href="https://linktr.ee/ogtobesin?utm_source=linktree_profile_share&ltsid=75bfdcf9-4273-4b8c-88a6-034c1e959cd6" target="_blank">My latest song</a>. 
              Enough of music. I have so many goals in life but one of them is to change how people think of Africa as a darkout continent and poor. </p>
